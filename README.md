# Overview

[Jackson](/FasterXML/jackson) data format module for reading and writing data encoded as so-called
[INI files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file); textual data format used mostly for
configuration files. Such files have been popular on platforms like Windows, as well as for
some scripting languages (Python), although usage has been decreasing lately due to introduction
of more powerful alternatives, such as XML, JSON and YAML.
